# IS Library and Media Preservation Lab: Epson Scanner documentation
Last updated: May 7, 2024

## Overview
The Epson scanner workflow documentation provides instructions for every stage of the scanning process for still images, documents, and film, including:
1. **Pre-scanning:** Understanding the rules, guidelines, tips, and tricks which will result in the highest quality scan of selected materials as efficiently as possible. This includes identifying different types of film, configuring scanner and software settings, recommended archival standards for digitization, and practices to avoid.
2. **Scanning:** Navigating the physical placement of materials on the scanner, using the EPSON Scan software, and making adjustments during the scanning process so as to achieve the ideal scan.
3. **Post-scanning:** Inspecting and verifying the finished scan for quality, as well as file management considerations for the long-term storage of digitized materials.

The Epson scanner is located at the Scanning Station, in Zone C of the IS Library, by the Mac computers. The Epson scanner is connected to the Mac desktop directly adjacent to the wall; this computer must be used for all scanning purposes. In order to use the scanner, please [book an appointment for the Scanning Station via Appointlet](https://dashboard.appointlet.com/profiles/47049/scheduling-pages/48115?updatingMeetingTypeId=293569).

## Considerations for photographs and documents

* **The maximum document size** allowed by the scanner is **12.2” x 17.2” (310 x 437 mm).** However, the most common size used in the U.S. is Ledger or B-size (11” x 17”). Any materials larger than 12.22” x 17.2” or 310mm x 437mm **should not** be scanned with the Epson; they are better suited to a copy stand instead, so as to prevent denting or damage to the materials. **This is especially important to consider for fragile, valuable, and antique documents that are oversized.**
* FADGI, the Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative, recommends the following specifications for the scanning of 2-D materials (refer to the chart below). Please configure the Epson SCAN software settings accordingly:

| Type of material | Recommended Resolution | Recommended File Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Documents, maps, posters, newspapers, and manuscripts | 400ppi (pixels per inch) | TIFF, JPG 2000, or PDF/A |
| Prints, photographs, and film | 600 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 |
| Photographic transparencies 4x5 inch or larger | 2000 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 file |
| Photographic transparencies, from 35mm to 4x5 inch | 4000 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 |
| Photographic negatives, 35mm to 4x5 inch | 4000 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 |
| Photographic negatives, 4x5 inch or larger | 2000 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 |
| Paintings and 2-dimensional fine art | 600 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 |

## Scanning workflow
### Placing materials on the scanner.

Please follow the directions relevant for the materials to be scanned.

**Placing a single photo or single-page document:**
1. Raise the scanner cover and place the document face-down on the document table. Place it in the upper-left hand corner, aligning it with the edges of the glass.
2. Close the document cover, being careful not to move the document or photo.
  > a. If the edges of the document or photo do not scan properly, adjust by moving it inwards about 1/16 of an inch away from the edges of the glass.
3. To scan a thick item, such as a photo in an album, lift the back of the cover straight up. When reinserting the cover, line up the hinge pins with the positioning holes. Then lower the cover into place.
  > a. **A note regarding multi-page documents:** FADGI guidelines dissuade the use of an automatic document feeder, or ADF. This is due to the probability of unwanted artifacts appearing in the scan. Please refer to Using Adobe Acrobat to combine multiple Scanned PDFs into a multi-page document for instructions on how to compile multiple pages into a single document.

### Crop in Photoshop

1. To crop the image, select the Crop icon from the left toolbar (seen below), or press C on the keyboard. A dotted line will border the image, indicating that the image has entered cropping mode. Pressing ENTER will accept any subsequent crop. Command + Z will undo any subsequent crop. Consider the following options to aid the cropping process:
> a. To lock the aspect ratio of the image, keeping the proportionality of the image’s dimensions intact, **hold down the SHIFT key while dragging a corner handle of the border.**

> b. To resize the image from its center, **hold down the OPTION key** while dragging a center handle.

> c. To both lock the aspect ratio and resize the image from its center, **press and hold the SHIFT + OPTION keys** while dragging a center handle. 

> d. To toggle the orientation of the cropping border, between portrait and landscape, **press the X key.**

> e. To make the excluded margins visible or invisible, press the H key.

> f. To change the image position while the border stays fixed, click **inside** the border and drag the image around to reposition it.

> g. To move the cropping border while the image stays fixed, **press the P key.** Then, click and drag inside the border to reposition it. To return to the default mode, press the P key again.

> h. To change the cropping overlay, select the icon shown below, located in the top toolbar above the image.

_Dropdown menu for cropping overlays._

A drop down menu will appear with the following list of overlays as options:
* Rule of Thirds
* Grid
* Diagonal
* Triangle
* Golden Ratio
* Golden Spiral

Pressing the O key will cycle through these options. Feel free to use these overlays as visual guides, to bear the image’s composition in mind while performing a crop. The following options toggle the visibility of the overlays:
* Auto Show Overlay: visible only while adjusting the cropping border
* Always Show Overlay: visible all the time
* Never Show Overlay: invisible all the time

### Add a border in Photoshop
The Cropping tool may also be used to add a colored border to the image. To do so, please follow the directions below:

1. Press Command + J. This duplicates the image, allowing it to remain separate from the border.
2. To change the default border color from white to another shade, select the border color icon, pictured below, accessible from the left toolbar. A pane with a variety of shades will appear. Click a shade to specify the new border color.
